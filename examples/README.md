# fw-registry Examples

This provides examples on building and using a workflow.

## Setup

Follow the instructions from the `Readme.md` file at the root of this repository.

If using the `fw-cli`, then these examples require that the `wd` (Working Directory) for `fw-registry` to be set to this examples sub-directory.

Such as:
```shell
fw config set wd fw-registry/examples
```

The `wd` variable in the `fw-cli` configuration should then look something like this:
```
  "wd": "fw-registry/examples",
```
